Coursera-getdata assignment
-----

The script follows the basic instructions in the course project:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

Comments inside the script refer to the steps above. There is only one small change in sequence between steps 3 and 4.
